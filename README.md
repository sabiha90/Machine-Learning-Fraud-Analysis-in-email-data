Fraud Detection in the Enron email dataset

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for to executives. Using Sklearn's machine learning algorithms, I detected the persons of interest that were involved in the fraud from a set of Enron emails which can be found in the final project report.
